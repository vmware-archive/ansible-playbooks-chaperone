# Chaperone Playbooks

This repository provides playbooks associated with the
[Chaperone](https://github.com/vmware/chaperone) project
for configuring and installing various Software Defined Data Center ("SDDC")
scenarios.

One should note that the playbooks herein show general examples, though are
used for their purposes. But where new scenarios, for example a specific
model of automating a particular setup of certificates, or other use cases
for automation, you will need to make new directories for your playbooks.
In such cases, it is perfectly viable to create your own independently
managed "playbooks" project and use a [Local Manifest](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/master/docs/manifest-format.txt#335)
to remove this playbook repo and replace it with yours. For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest>
  <remove-project name=ansible-playbooks-chaperone />
  <project path="ansible/playbooks" name="my_github_id/ansible-playbooks-chaperone" remote="github"/>
</manifest>
```

See the docs directory in the
[Chaperone](https://github.com/vmware/chaperone) project for detailed
startup instructions for developers and users. Also, for easy developer
setup using Docker Containers, see the documentation in
[photon_setup](chaperone-appc-devbox).

# Playbook Descriptions

### ansible
Intended for installing ansible on a host the correct way, with needed extra modules

### chaperone-ui
Intended to setup the Deployment server.  It does the following:
* install the webserver needed to
  * host the Chaperone UI,
  * host deployment assets (isos, ovas, ovfs needed to perform installation of various)
* clone local chaperone ansible resources (playbooks, roles, modules, etc.) to the Deployment Server for use via the UI
* install any extra tools needed on the Deployment Server

### chaperone
This set of playbooks is intended to be run from the Deployment Server to do the actual
work of deploying various SDDC artifacts.

It is called by the UI after the UI has been used to specify the environment configuration.
The UI generates the *answersfile.yml* that is referenced in all these playbooks.


### chaperone-appc-devbox
**Depricated**
This is intended to run against a photon machine to install
docker and containerized versions of the CDS and DE.

### gerrit
**Depricated**
For use in setting up a shared gerrit server for use in
development environment.


### jenkins
Sets up a jenkins server and haproxy to expose it.

### labrouter

For setting up dnsmasq and iptables in a lab setup.

### photon

**Depricated**
For setting up a basic photon vm.


# Known Issues:
* Getting an error like `/bin/sh: 1: /usr/bin/python: not found`

Try running the following on the remote host: `apt-get -y install python-simplejson` and re-try the playbook.

See for more info: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32429259/ansible-fails-with-bin-sh-1-usr-bin-python-not-found


* when running chaperone-ui/base.yml `chgrp failed: failed to look up group tscanlan`

Chances are your local user is not vmware, and it does not exist on the remote side.
The error is in sshkeys, trying to set permissions to your uid/gid.

Fix: pass `-e 'sshkeys_user=vmware'` to the ansible-playbook command

    ansible-playbook  -vv -e 'sshkeys_user=vmware'  -i inventory base.yml
